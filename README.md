## What is Bartender?

Bartender is a highly specialized utility application designed to give you complete control over your macOS menu bar. In today's digital workspace, it's common for the menu bar to become overcrowded with icons from various applications, leading to a cluttered and inefficient user interface. Bartender solves this problem elegantly by providing powerful tools to manage this space effectively.

This application allows you to hide any menu bar icon you choose, keeping them readily available in a separate, customizable Bartender Bar that can be revealed with a click or a keyboard shortcut. You can also reorder your icons, creating a layout that perfectly matches your workflow priorities. Beyond simple hiding, Bartender offers advanced features like searching your menu bar items and setting rules for individual icons (always show, always hide, show when active). This level of customization ensures that your most important information is always visible while less critical icons are kept neatly organized and accessible. Bartender is lightweight, runs seamlessly in the background, and is trusted by professionals worldwide to maintain a clean and productive computing environment on their Macs.
